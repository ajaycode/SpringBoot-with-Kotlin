### Spring Boot Security
This is an example of Spring Boot Security with a custom login page. It contains
* authentication
* authorization
* custom login page

There are two users as follows:
* "user" with a password of "user"
* "admin" with a password of "admin"

The password for "user" is hashed using bcrypt-generator.com and hard coded into WebSecurityConfiguration.kt
The password for "admin" is hashed using BcryptPasswordEncoder().

Logout capability is available by adding the "logout" keyword to the login URL as below
http://localhost:8080/login?**logout**
Logout is available in 
* /all - Implemented in html
* /admin page - embedded into the return string of admin () method

Access to pages is as follows:
* "user" has access to /user
* "admin" has access to /admin
* /all is accessible to authenticated users - "user" and "admin"
* / is accessible without authentication

To try it out:
* access http://localhost:8080/user and login as "user"/"user"
* logout at http://localhost:8080/login?logout 
* access http://localhost:8080/admin and login as "admin"/"admin"
* access http://localhost:8080/all as either "user" or "admin"
